##Recitation Peer Review em186 - sml59

We discussed about the class ViewSection.java in slogo

The methods are too long, they could use being divided in smaller methods.
There are some hardcoded constants that need justification.
Use more desciptive methods. Names of variables are a bit too abstract. 
Too many different variables defined in the same method, use helper methods instead. 
You can't change the order in which you add things to the scrollpane.
